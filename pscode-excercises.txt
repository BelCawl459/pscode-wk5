// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

// This program will calculate the sum of two numbers and output the sum.
BEGIN
Write "Please enter two numbers to add together"
Read Number1
Read Number2
Total = Number1 + Number2
Write Total
End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

//Pseudocode to check whether number is odd or even
START.
DISPLAY "Enter the Number x"
READ number.

IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN.
DISPLAY "Number is Even"
ELSE.
DISPLAY "Number is Odd"
END IF.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// This Pseudocode will collect 5 input numbers, calculat etheir averages, and find both the smallest and the largest of them. It will then output a message describing the aformentioned functions

BEGIN
Write "Please Enter 5 numbers for calculation"
Sum = 0.0
For Loop with i ranging from 0 - 5
Inside loop sum=n[i]+sum
Outside loop Avg=sum/5
Print avg

Small=n[0] //Assuming the first number in the list is the smallest
Large= n[0] //Assume the First number in the list is the largest
For Loop with i ranging from 0-5
Inside loop if n[i]<Small // If another number is smaller than the small variable
Inside if Then small =n[i]
Inside loop if n[i]>Large // If any number is larger than large(variable) 
Inside if then large=n[i]
Print Small
Print Large 

print Avg
print Small
print Large
